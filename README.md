# AzureSIEMLab
<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of a building my own Security Operations Center by deploying a SIEM that monitors and generates alerts for all the devices within the home lab. I also set up a threat intelligence feed that sends IOCs to the SIEM.
<br />

<h2>Environments and Utilities</h2>

- <b>Microsoft Azure</b>

<h2>Project Setup</h2>
The first step to the lab is setting up the Azure Environment. I needed to create a virtual machine, that would be used to monitor RDP events. I created a Windows 10 Machine and opened up RDP on port: 3389.
